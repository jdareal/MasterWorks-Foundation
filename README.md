"description": "Enzo Ferarri said "If you can dream it, you can do it." Keeping that entrepreneurial and innovative spirit in mind, we are proud to announce that MasterWorks Block9 Dreamcars is no longer a dream. We did it. A beautiful collection of 222 timeless Digital Artifacts, all handmade, all dynamic, and all immutably inscribed on Block 9. Collectors will see a myriad of ever-changing scenery each time they open their Ordinal. A mighty roar of the engine, with sounds accurately reflecting that specific model featured. Now we start our engines, reshaping the boundaries of what is achievable and redefining the limits of this digital revolution.",
